## What's shipped

### Core framework
- ✅ `Mob.Socket`, `Mob.Screen`, `Mob.Component`, `Mob.Registry`, `Mob.Renderer`
- ✅ HelloScreen on Android emulator (Pixel 8) and real Moto phone (non-rooted)
- ✅ HelloScreen on iOS simulator (iPhone 17) via SwiftUI
- ✅ CounterScreen — tap → NIF → `enif_send` → `handle_event` → re-render (both platforms)
- ✅ Erlang distribution on Android (`Mob.Dist`, deferred 3s to avoid hwui mutex race)
- ✅ Erlang distribution on iOS (simulator shares Mac network stack, reads `MOB_DIST_PORT` env)
- ✅ Simultaneous Android + iOS connection — both nodes in one IEx cluster
- ✅ Battery benchmarking — Nerves tuning flags (`+sbwt none +S 1:1` etc.) adopted as production default in `mob_beam.c`
- ✅ `mob_nif:log/2` NIF + `Mob.NativeLogger` OTP handler → Elixir Logger → platform system log (logcat / NSLog) on both Android and iOS
- ✅ Navigation stack — `push_screen`, `pop_screen`, `pop_to_root`, `pop_to`, `reset_to` in `Mob.Socket`
- ✅ Animated transitions — `:push`, `:pop`, `:reset`, `:none` passed through renderer to NIF
- ✅ Back buttons on all demo screens; `handle_info` catch-all guards against FunctionClauseError crash (added to all 6 mob_demo screens)
- ✅ SELinux fix in deployer — `chcon -hR` (not `-R`) copies MCS category from app's own `files/` dir after push AND before restart, preventing category mismatch. `-h` flag prevents symlink dereferencing — critical because `mob_beam.c` symlinks `BINDIR/erl_child_setup → nativeLibDir/liberl_child_setup.so`, and `-R` would follow those symlinks and corrupt the native lib labels
- ✅ Android 15 `apk_data_file` fix — streaming `adb install` on Android 15 labels ERTS helper `.so` files (`liberl_child_setup.so` etc.) as `app_data_file` (blocks `execute_no_trans`). `mix mob.deploy --native` now runs `fix_erts_helper_labels/2` after each APK install: uses `pm dump` to find native lib dir, then `chcon u:object_r:apk_data_file:s0` on the 3 helpers (rooted/emulator only — silently skipped on production builds)
- ✅ `scroll` explicit wrapper — `axis: :vertical/:horizontal`, `show_indicator: false` (iOS); `HelloScreen`/`CounterScreen` wrap root column in scroll
- ✅ `Mob.Style` struct — `%Mob.Style{props: map}` wraps reusable prop maps; merged by renderer at serialisation time
- ✅ Style token system — atom tokens (`:primary`, `:xl`, `:gray_600`, etc.) resolved in `Mob.Renderer` before JSON serialisation; no runtime cost on the native side
- ✅ Platform blocks — `:ios` / `:android` nested prop keys resolved by renderer; wrong platform's block silently dropped
- ✅ Wave A components: `box` (ZStack), `divider`, `spacer` (fixed), `progress` (linear, determinate + indeterminate) — both platforms
- ✅ `ComponentsScreen` in mob_demo — exercises all Wave A components and style tokens
- ✅ Wave B components: `text_field` (keyboard types, focus/blur/submit events), `toggle`, `slider` — both platforms
- ✅ `InputScreen` in mob_demo — exercises text_field / toggle / slider with live event feedback
- ✅ `image` — `AsyncImage` (iOS built-in) + Coil (Android); `src`, `content_mode`, `width`, `height`, `corner_radius`, `placeholder_color` props
- ✅ `lazy_list` — `LazyVStack` (iOS) + `LazyColumn` (Android); `on_end_reached` event for infinite scroll
- ✅ `Mob.List` — high-level list component wrapping `lazy_list`; `on_select`, `on_end_reached` events; default and custom renderers; event routing via `{:list, id, :select, index}` tuples intercepted in `Mob.Screen` and re-dispatched as `{:select, id, index}`
- ✅ `ListScreen` in mob_demo — 30 items initial, appends 20 on each end_reached; both default and custom renderers exercised
- ✅ `Mob.Test` — RPC-based app automation for programmatic testing: `screen/1`, `assigns/1`, `tap/2`, `find/2`, `inspect/1`; drives running apps without touching native UI; used for QA tour and regression testing

### QA fixes (2026-04-16)
- ✅ `renderer.ex` — `on_tap` with tuple tag (e.g. `{:list, id, :select, index}`) no longer crashes `Atom.to_string/1`; split into two clauses: atom tag includes `accessibility_id`, non-atom tag omits it
- ✅ `tab_screen.ex` (mob_demo) — `text_size: "2xl"` (string) changed to `text_size: :"2xl"` (atom); renderer's token resolution requires atoms
- ✅ `MobRootView.swift` — Tab content frame fixed: added `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)` to `MobNodeView` in `MobTabView` so content is top-aligned, not bottom-aligned
- ✅ `MobRootView.swift` — Tab background fill fixed: `MobTabView` applies `child.backgroundColor` to the outer frame wrapper so the tab area background fills to the bottom, not just behind content
- ✅ `device_screen.ex` (mob_demo) — Motion throttle fixed: `rem(data.timestamp, 5) == 0` is always true for 100ms-interval timestamps (all divisible by 5); corrected to `rem(div(data.timestamp, 100), 5) == 0`

### Toolchain (all published on Hex)
- ✅ `mix mob.new APP_NAME` — generates full Android + iOS project from templates
- ✅ `mix mob.install` — first-run: downloads pre-built OTP, generates icons, writes mob.exs
- ✅ `mix mob.deploy [--native]` — compile + push BEAMs via Erlang dist (no restart) when nodes are connected; falls back to adb/cp + restart when not; `--native` also builds APK/app bundle
- ✅ `mix mob.push` — compile + hot-push changed modules via Erlang dist (no restart)
- ✅ `mix mob.watch` — auto-push on file save via dist
- ✅ `mix mob.watch_stop` — stops a running mob.watch process
- ✅ `mix mob.routes` — validates all `push_screen`/`reset_to`/`pop_to` call targets against `Mob.Nav.Registry`; warns on unregistered destinations
- ✅ `mix mob.connect` — tunnel + restart + wait for nodes + IEx
- ✅ `mix mob.battery_bench` — A/B test BEAM scheduler configs with mAh measurements
- ✅ `mix mob.icon` — regenerate icons (random robot or from source image)
- ✅ Pre-built OTP tarballs on GitHub (android + ios-sim), downloaded automatically

### mob_dev server (v0.2.2)
- ✅ Device discovery (adb + xcrun simctl), live device cards
- ✅ Per-device deploy buttons (Update / First Deploy)
- ✅ Live log streaming (logcat + iOS simulator log stream)
- ✅ Log filter (App / All / per-device) + free-text filter (comma-separated terms)
- ✅ Deploy output terminal inline per device card
- ✅ Elixir Logger → dashboard (mob_nif:log/2 pipeline)
- ✅ QR code in header — encodes LAN URL for opening dashboard on phone
- ✅ `mix mob.server` — starts server, binds to 0.0.0.0:4040, prints QR in terminal
- ✅ "Push on save" toggle in dashboard — `MobDev.Server.WatchWorker` GenServer; toggle in UI starts/stops file watching + dist push; shows last push time and module count
- ✅ `HotPush` NIF tolerance — `on_load_failure` from `:code.load_binary` is silently ignored for NIF modules (`:mob_nif`, `Vix.Nif` etc.) that are already loaded and can't be re-initialized; prevents false deploy failures

---

## Deploy model (architectural decision 2026-04-14)

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full write-up. Short version:

- **`mix mob.deploy --native`** — USB required. Full push: builds APK/IPA, installs via adb/xcrun, copies BEAMs.
- **`mix mob.deploy`** — USB optional. Fast push: compiles BEAMs, saves to mob_dev server, distributes to connected nodes via Erlang dist. Falls back to adb push if no dist connection.
- **`mix mob.push` / `mix mob.watch`** — dist only. Hot-loads changed modules in place, no restart.

USB is only required for first deploy. After that, Erlang distribution is the transport for all code updates across both Android and iOS.

### 1. ~~Styling system — `Mob.Style`~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**

- `%Mob.Style{props: map}` struct — thin wrapper so the future `~MOB` sigil can pattern-match on it; zero cost before serialisation
- Token resolution in `Mob.Renderer`: atom values for color props (`:primary`, `:gray_600`, etc.) resolve to ARGB integers; atom values for `:text_size` resolve to sp floats. Token tables are module attributes — compile-time constants
- Platform blocks — `:ios` / `:android` keys in props are resolved by renderer before serialisation; the other platform's block is dropped silently
- `%Mob.Style{}` under the `:style` prop key is merged into the node's own props; inline props override style values
- Demo screens converted to tokens; `ComponentsScreen` added

**Still to do (style-adjacent):**
- [ ] `~MOB` sigil: `style={...}` attribute support (Phase 2 — sigil upgrade)
- [ ] `depth/1`, `font_style/1` semantic abstractions — NIF changes needed on both platforms
- [ ] User-defined token extensions via `MyApp.Styles` + mob.exs config
- [ ] `font_weight`, `rounded`, `opacity`, `border` props on both platforms

---

### 2. ~~Event model extension — value-bearing events~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**

- `{:change, tag, value}` — 3-tuple sent by NIFs for value-bearing inputs. Tap stays as `{:tap, tag}` (backward-compatible).
- Value types: binary string (text_field), boolean atom (toggle), float (slider)
- `on_change: {pid, tag}` prop registered via the existing tap handle registry; the C side determines whether to send `:tap` or `:change` based on which sender function is called
- Added to both platforms: `mob_send_change_str/bool/float` in Android `mob_nif.c`; static equivalents in iOS `mob_nif.m`
- Wave B components implemented: `text_field`, `toggle`, `slider` — both platforms
- `InputScreen` demo exercises all three with live state feedback

---

### 3. ~~Back button / hardware navigation~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**

- Android `BackHandler` in `MainActivity` intercepts the system back gesture and calls `MobBridge.nativeHandleBack()` → `mob_handle_back()` C function
- iOS `UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer` on `MobHostingController` (left edge) calls `mob_handle_back()` directly
- `mob_handle_back()` uses `enif_whereis_pid` to find `:mob_screen` and sends `{:mob, :back}` to the BEAM
- `Mob.Screen` intercepts `{:mob, :back}` before user's `handle_info` — automatic on all screens, no user code needed
- Nav stack non-empty → pops with `:pop` transition; stack empty → calls `exit_app/0` NIF
- `exit_app` on Android: `activity.moveTaskToBack(true)` (backgrounds, does not kill); on iOS: no-op (OS handles home gesture)
- `Mob.Screen` registers itself as `:mob_screen` on init (render mode only)

**Design decisions recorded:**
- "Home screen" = whatever is at the bottom of the stack after `reset_to`. No separate concept needed.
- After login, `reset_to(MainScreen)` zeroes the stack; back at root backgrounds the app.
- `moveTaskToBack` preferred over `finish()` — users achieve apps to persist in the switcher.
- Dynamic home screen (login vs main) is a `reset_to` convention, not a framework feature.

### 4. ~~Safe area insets~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**

- `mob_nif:safe_area/0` → `{top, right, bottom, left}` floats (logical points / dp)
  - iOS: reads `UIWindow.safeAreaInsets` on the main thread via `dispatch_sync`
  - Android: reads `decorView.rootWindowInsets` via `CountDownLatch` in `MobBridge`
- `Mob.Screen.init` injects `assigns.safe_area = %{top: t, right: r, bottom: b, left: l}` before `mount/3` is called — always available, zero opt-in
- `MobRootView` uses `.ignoresSafeArea(.container, edges: [.bottom, .horizontal])` — top safe area respected automatically; bottom/sides fill edge-to-edge
- Framework does not insert any automatic padding — values are information only, developer decides what to do with them
- Documented in README under `## Display`

### 5. ~~Per-edge padding~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**
- `padding_top`, `padding_right`, `padding_bottom`, `padding_left` props on all layout nodes
- Any missing edge falls back to the uniform `padding` value; all absent → no padding
- iOS: `paddingEdgeInsets` computed property on `MobNode` returns `EdgeInsets`; all `.padding(node.padding)` calls in `MobRootView.swift` replaced with `.padding(node.paddingEdgeInsets)`
- Android: `nodeModifier` updated to detect edge props; uses `Modifier.padding(top=, end=, bottom=, start=)` when any edge is present, uniform `.padding()` otherwise
- Usage: `padding_top: trunc(assigns.safe_area.top) + 16, padding: 16` — top clears the status bar; sides and bottom get uniform 16dp padding

### 6. ~~Typography~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**
- `font_weight: :bold | :semibold | :medium | :regular | :light | :thin`
- `text_align: :left | :center | :right`
- `italic: true`
- `line_height` multiplier (e.g. `1.4`) — converted to inter-line spacing on both platforms
- `letter_spacing` in sp/pt
- `font: "FontName"` — custom family; falls back to system font if not installed
- No renderer changes needed — OTP's `:json.encode` serialises atom values as strings
- iOS: `resolvedFont` + `textAlignEnum` + `computedLineSpacing` computed properties on MobNode Swift extension; applied to label case in `MobRootView`
- Android: `fontWeightProp`, `textAlignProp`, `fontFamilyProp` helpers in `MobBridge.kt`; applied to `MobText` composable
- Font bundling (`priv/fonts/` + `mix mob.deploy --native`) is a separate step

### 7. ~~Tab bar / drawer navigation~~ ✅ Done (tab bar; drawer Phase 2)

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**
- `type: :tab_bar` node with `tabs: [%{id:, label:, icon:}]`, `active:`, `on_tab_select:`
- Tab selection sends `{:change, tag, tab_id_string}` to screen's `handle_info` (reuses existing change mechanism)
- `on_tab_select: {self(), tag}` registered in `Mob.Renderer.prepare_props/3`
- iOS: `MobTabView` SwiftUI struct using `TabView` with SF Symbol icons; `MobNodeTypeTabBar` added to enum
- Android: `MobTabBar` composable using `Scaffold` + `NavigationBar`; `tabDefsProp` parses `JSONArray` from props
- `MobDemo.TabScreen` demo with 3 tabs, also exercises typography props

### 8. ~~Nav animations — iOS~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-15):**
- Added `@State private var currentTransition: String = "none"` to `MobRootView`
- Set `currentTransition = t` BEFORE the `withAnimation` block so the modifier sees the right value when the new view is inserted
- Added `.id(model.rootVersion)` to `MobNodeView` — forces SwiftUI to treat each root update as a distinct view insertion/removal, enabling asymmetric push/pop slide transitions rather than a whole-screen fade

### ~~(9, 10, 11 assigned elsewhere)~~

### 12. (KitchenSink — deferred to later)

## Device capabilities — shipped

### Haptics ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

No permission required.

```elixir
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :light)    # brief tap
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :medium)   # standard tap
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :heavy)    # strong tap
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :success)  # success pattern
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :error)    # error pattern
Mob.Haptic.trigger(socket, :warning)  # warning pattern
```

Returns socket unchanged so it can be used inline. Fire-and-forget (dispatch_async / runOnUiThread).
- iOS: `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` / `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator`
- Android: `View.performHapticFeedback` with `HapticFeedbackConstants`
- NIF: `mob_nif:haptic/1` on both platforms

### Clipboard ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

No permission required.

```elixir
Mob.Clipboard.put(socket, "some text")
case Mob.Clipboard.get(socket) do
  {:clipboard, :ok, text} -> ...
  {:clipboard, :empty}    -> ...
end
```

`get/1` is synchronous (dispatch_sync / CountDownLatch), same pattern as `safe_area/0`.
- iOS: `UIPasteboard.generalPasteboard`
- Android: `ClipboardManager` / `ClipData`
- NIFs: `mob_nif:clipboard_put/1`, `mob_nif:clipboard_get/0`

### Share sheet ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

No permission required. Fire-and-forget.

```elixir
Mob.Share.text(socket, "Check out Mob!")
```

- iOS: `UIActivityViewController` with popover support for iPad
- Android: `Intent.ACTION_SEND` via `Intent.createChooser`
- NIF: `mob_nif:share_text/1`

---

### Typography (original item 6)

Text props that are missing on both platforms:

- `font: "Inter"` — custom font family by name; falls back to system font if not found
- `font_weight: :bold | :semibold | :medium | :regular | :light`
- `text_align: :left | :center | :right`
- `italic: true`
- `line_height` (multiplier, e.g. `1.4`)
- `letter_spacing` (sp/pt)

**Custom fonts:** bundled in the app as asset files (`.ttf` / `.otf`). Developer drops fonts into `priv/fonts/` in their Mix project; `mix mob.deploy --native` copies them into the right platform directories and patches `Info.plist` for iOS. iOS uses the PostScript name directly; Android requires lowercase+underscore filenames (`Inter-Regular.ttf` → `inter_regular`), so `Mob.Renderer` normalises the name before JSON serialisation.

Downloadable / web fonts (Google Fonts API etc.) are a nice-to-have for later — network-dependent and significantly more complex.

Token additions in `Mob.Renderer` for `font_weight`. NIF side: `font` / `text_weight` / `text_align` JSON fields → `UIFont(name:size:)` (iOS) / `FontFamily` + `FontWeight` (Android).

### 7. Tab bar / drawer navigation

Most real apps have a persistent tab bar (bottom nav) or a side drawer. Currently nav is a push/pop stack only.

**Tab bar:**
- Defined in `Mob.App.navigation/1` alongside the stack declaration (same place as today's `stack`)
- `tab_bar/1` macro takes a list of `{label, icon_atom, screen_module}` entries
- Active tab is part of `Mob.Screen` state; `Mob.Socket.switch_tab/2` sends to a sibling tab's screen
- Each tab has its own independent nav stack
- iOS: `UITabBarController` wrapper; Android: `NavigationBar` composable at the bottom

**Drawer:**
- `drawer/1` macro in `Mob.App.navigation/1`
- Opened by `Mob.Socket.open_drawer/1`, closed by `close_drawer/1`
- Rendered as a slide-in panel from the left; content is a regular screen tree

**Back-gesture interaction:** back gesture at stack root should go to previous tab if tabs are active, not background the app.

### 8. Nav animations — iOS

iOS `MobRootView` already has `navTransition/1` and `navAnimation/1` helpers and a `.transition()` modifier, but they're applied to the entire root view swap, not to individual screen transitions. The result is a whole-screen fade rather than a proper push slide.

**Goal:** Match Android's `AnimatedContent` behaviour — slide in from right (push), slide in from left (pop), fade (reset).

iOS approach: keep `MobRootView` as-is but switch `ZStack` + `.transition()` to `withAnimation` around the `currentRoot` state update, paired with `.transition(.asymmetric(...))` on `MobNodeView`. This is already scaffolded in the current code; needs the transition to be applied to the `MobNodeView` level rather than the `ZStack` level.

### ~~9. `mix mob.deploy` → dist~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-16):**
`mix mob.deploy` now tries Erlang dist first (hot-loads with no restart); falls back to adb push + restart when no dist connection. NIF modules that fail hot-reload (`on_load_failure`) are silently tolerated.

### ~~10. `mix mob.watch` in mob_dev dashboard~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-16):**
`MobDev.Server.WatchWorker` GenServer wraps the watch loop. Toggle in dashboard UI starts/stops it with last-push-time and module-count status.

### ~~11. `mix mob.routes` validation~~ ✅ Done

**Shipped (2026-04-16):**
`mix mob.routes` walks all `push_screen`/`reset_to`/`pop_to` call sites, checks targets against `Mob.Nav.Registry`, and warns on unregistered destinations.

### 12. KitchenSink screen
All components exercised in one demo screen: `column`, `row`, `scroll`, `box`, `text`, `button`, `text_field`, `toggle`, `slider`, `divider`, `spacer`, `progress`, `image`, `lazy_list`.
Update after per-edge padding (item 5) and typography (item 6) land.

### 13. Permission / capability build wizard (mob_dev dashboard)

**Problem:** Native permission declarations must be in place at build time — `AndroidManifest.xml` for Android, `Info.plist` for iOS — but today developers have to edit those files by hand. This is one of the most friction-heavy parts of the first-deploy flow, especially for less experienced mobile developers.

**Goal:** A wizard in the mob_dev dashboard that lets developers declare which device capabilities their app uses. The wizard writes the correct platform manifest entries and regenerates files before the next `mix mob.deploy --native`.

**UX sketch:**

The wizard lives in the mob_dev dashboard under a "Build Config" or "Capabilities" tab. It shows a checklist of capabilities:

| Capability | Description | Android permission | iOS key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Camera | Capture photo / video | `CAMERA` | `NSCameraUsageDescription` |
| Microphone | Audio recording | `RECORD_AUDIO` | `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` |
| Location (coarse) | Cell/wifi position | `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` |
| Location (fine) | GPS | `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | (same key, finer entitlement) |
| Photo library read | Pick photos | `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` (API 33+) / `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` |
| Photo library write | Save photos | `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (API < 29) | `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` |
| Notifications (local) | Schedule local alerts | `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (API 33+) | (permission requested at runtime) |
| Biometric | FaceID / fingerprint | `USE_BIOMETRIC` | `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` |
| Bluetooth | BLE scan/connect | `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` | `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` |
| NFC | Tag read/write | `NFC` | `NFCReaderUsageDescription` |

Each capability has an optional **usage description** field (iOS requires a human-readable string explaining why the app needs it; Android 13+ notifications also require one).

**Implementation:**

- Capability selections + usage strings stored in `mob.exs` under a `:capabilities` key
- `mix mob.deploy --native` reads `mob.exs[:capabilities]` and patches:
  - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — adds `<uses-permission>` entries
  - `ios/Info.plist` — adds `NS*UsageDescription` keys
- `mix mob.new` generates starter manifests with a comment block where Mob will inject permissions; this makes the files safe to patch idempotently
- Dashboard wizard writes to `mob.exs` in the project root via a LiveView form; changes take effect on next `--native` build
- Validation: warn if a `Mob.*` API is called in the BEAM code but the corresponding capability is not declared (cross-reference `Mob.Camera`, `Mob.Location` etc. call sites vs declared capabilities)

**mob.exs format:**

```elixir
import Config

config :mob_dev,
  bundle_id: "com.example.myapp",
  capabilities: [
    camera:       [usage: "Take profile photos"],
    microphone:   [usage: "Record voice memos"],
    location:     [accuracy: :coarse, usage: "Show nearby places"],
    photo_library:[access: :read, usage: "Choose a profile picture"],
    notifications:[],
    biometric:    [usage: "Confirm payments with Face ID"],
  ]
```

**Scope note:** The wizard UI and `mob.exs` schema live in `mob_dev`. The manifest patching logic (`patch_android_manifest/1`, `patch_ios_plist/1`) lives in `mob_dev` alongside `NativeBuild`. The capability→permission mapping table is a compile-time constant in `mob_dev`.

## List component overhaul ✅ Phase 1 shipped (2026-04-15)

`Mob.List` Phase 1 is live. `lazy_list` stays for backward compat; `list` is the new component. Phase 2 items (swipe actions, sections, pull-to-refresh) are still pending.

The current `lazy_list` requires the caller to `Enum.map` their data into pre-rendered node trees and pass them as children. The `list` component gives Elixir developers something that behaves like a list out of the box, with full customisation available when needed.

### Component and event model

Every list lives inside a **wrapper component** — either one the developer explicitly defines, or an implicit one the framework creates automatically. List events surface at the wrapper boundary, never at the screen level unless the list is unwrapped.

**One list on a screen — list is its own implicit wrapper:**
```elixir
%{type: :list, props: %{id: :items, items: assigns.items, on_select: {self(), :items}}}

def handle_info({:select, :items, index}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:end_reached, :items}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:refresh, :items}, socket), do: ...
```

**Multiple lists — each wrapped in an explicit `Mob.Component`:**
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RecentList do
  use Mob.Component

  def init(socket), do: Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :items, [])

  def render(assigns) do
    %{type: :list, props: %{id: :recent, items: assigns.items}}
  end

  # Events are contained here — never leak to the parent screen
  def handle_info({:select, :recent, index}, socket), do: ...
end
```

`Mob.Component` is the event isolation boundary. The developer never has to think about event routing leaking between lists as long as they follow the wrapper rule.

### Default data list

No boilerplate for the simple case. Default renderer shows each item as a text row:

```elixir
# Works immediately — renders each item as a plain text row
%{type: :list, props: %{id: :items, items: assigns.items}}
```

Default renderer logic: if item is a binary, render as text. If a map, look for `:label`, `:title`, or `:name` key, fall back to `inspect/1`.

### Custom renderer

Registered at mount time, referenced by the list by id:

```elixir
def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  socket =
    socket
    |> Mob.Socket.assign(:items, [])
    |> Mob.List.put_renderer(socket, :items, &item_row/1)
  {:ok, socket}
end

defp item_row(item) do
  %{type: :row, props: %{padding: 12}, children: [
    %{type: :text, props: %{text: item.title}},
    %{type: :text, props: %{text: item.subtitle, text_color: :gray_500}}
  ]}
end
```

The renderer is a plain Elixir function stored in assigns. The BEAM calls it per item to produce children before handing off to the NIF — native-side virtualization still applies.

### Full props

```elixir
%{type: :list,
  props: %{
    id:              :my_list,
    items:           assigns.items,           # data, passed through renderer
    on_select:       {self(), :my_list},      # → {:select, :my_list, index}
    on_end_reached:  {self(), :my_list},      # → {:end_reached, :my_list}
    on_refresh:      {self(), :my_list},      # → {:refresh, :my_list}
    refreshing:      assigns.loading,         # shows pull-to-refresh spinner
    scroll_to:       assigns.scroll_index,    # jump to index (write-only)
  }}
```

Events arriving as `handle_info`:
- `{:select, id, index}` — row tapped; index is 0-based into `items`
- `{:end_reached, id}` — user scrolled near the bottom
- `{:refresh, id}` — pull-to-refresh gesture released
- `{:swipe, id, :left | :right, index}` — swipe action on a row (Phase 2)
- `{:scroll, id, %{index: n, offset: f}}` — scroll position (throttled, Phase 2)

### Swipe actions (Phase 2)

```elixir
%{type: :list_item,
  props: %{
    swipe_left:  [%{label: "Delete",  color: :red_600,  tag: :delete}],
    swipe_right: [%{label: "Archive", color: :blue_600, tag: :archive}],
  },
  children: [item_content_node]}
```

### Sections (Phase 2)

```elixir
%{type: :list, props: %{sticky_headers: true}, children: [
  %{type: :list_section, props: %{label: "Today"},     children: [...]},
  %{type: :list_section, props: %{label: "Yesterday"}, children: [...]},
]}
```

### Implementation notes

- `lazy_list` stays unchanged (backward compat). `list` is the new component.
- In `Mob.Renderer`, `type: :list` expands: items → children via renderer, then serialises as `lazy_list` to the NIF. No NIF changes needed for Phase 1.
- `on_select` implemented by wrapping each row in a tappable container in the renderer, with tag `{:list, id, :select, index}`. `Mob.Screen` intercepts `{:tap, {:list, id, :select, index}}` and re-dispatches as `{:select, id, index}`.
- `on_refresh` and `refreshing` require native changes (SwipeRefresh on Android, `.refreshable` on iOS) — Phase 2.
- iOS: `LazyVStack` for Phase 1; migrate to `List` view for swipe actions + sections in Phase 2.
- Android: `LazyColumn` for Phase 1; add `SwipeToDismiss` + `stickyHeader` in Phase 2.

## `Mob.Intent` — Android inter-app communication (planned)

Expose Android intents to Elixir so apps can reach out to other apps on the device (WhatsApp, email, browser, dialer, etc.).

### Elixir API

```elixir
# Send a message to a specific app (e.g. WhatsApp)
Mob.Intent.send(socket, package: "com.whatsapp", text: "Hello from the agent")

# Share sheet (existing Mob.Share) — chooser, no target package
Mob.Intent.send(socket, text: "Hello")

# Compose email
Mob.Intent.email(socket, to: "foo@example.com", subject: "Hi", body: "...")

# Open URL in browser
Mob.Intent.open_url(socket, "https://example.com")

# Open dialer (does not auto-dial)
Mob.Intent.dial(socket, "+1-555-1234")

# SMS
Mob.Intent.sms(socket, to: "+1-555-1234", body: "Hello")

# List installed apps the device can handle (subject to Android 11+ query restrictions)
Mob.Intent.installed_apps(socket)
# → arrives as {:intent_result, :installed_apps, [{package, label}, ...]}
```

All calls are fire-and-forget except `installed_apps` which delivers a result via `handle_info`.

### Android implementation

- `mob_intent_send/1`, `mob_intent_email/1`, `mob_intent_open_url/1`, `mob_intent_dial/1`, `mob_intent_sms/1`, `mob_intent_installed_apps/0` NIFs in `mob_nif.c` / `MobBridge.kt`
- `ACTION_SEND` with `setPackage(package)` for targeted sends; `createChooser` when no package specified
- `ACTION_SENDTO` with `mailto:` / `smsto:` URIs for email and SMS
- `ACTION_VIEW` for URLs and dialer
- `PackageManager.queryIntentActivities` for installed apps (requires `<queries>` entries in `AndroidManifest.xml`)
- All UI operations dispatch to main thread via `activity.runOnUiThread`

### iOS

Most of these map to `UIApplication.shared.open(url:)` with URL schemes:
- `whatsapp://send?text=...` — WhatsApp deep link
- `mailto:?to=...&subject=...&body=...`
- `http://` / `https://` — opens Safari
- `tel:` — opens Phone app
- `sms:?body=...`

iOS requires declaring URL schemes in `Info.plist` under `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to call `canOpenURL`. The capability build wizard (item 13) should handle this.

### Notes

- Android 11+ restricts `PackageManager.getInstalledApplications` — Play Store apps must declare specific `<queries>` or request `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` (restricted permission). `installed_apps` will only return apps the manifest declares queries for.
- Targeted sends (`package:`) silently fall back to the chooser if the target app is not installed.
- iOS does not have a general intent system; `Mob.Intent` on iOS is a URL scheme bridge.

---

## Device capabilities

Hardware APIs arrive as `handle_info` events, same as tap events. Permission requests are explicit — the developer calls `Mob.Permissions.request/2` and receives `{:permission, capability, :granted | :denied}` back.

### Permission model

```elixir
# Request a permission (shows OS dialog if not yet decided)
{:noreply, Mob.Permissions.request(socket, :camera)}

# Arrives as:
def handle_info({:permission, :camera, :granted}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:permission, :camera, :denied},  socket), do: ...
```

### Priority 1 — No permissions required

**Haptics**

Feedback for taps, errors, and successes. No permission needed.

```elixir
mob_nif:haptic(:light)    # light tap
mob_nif:haptic(:medium)   # medium tap
mob_nif:haptic(:heavy)    # heavy tap
mob_nif:haptic(:success)  # success pattern (iOS: UINotificationFeedbackGenerator)
mob_nif:haptic(:error)    # error pattern
mob_nif:haptic(:warning)  # warning pattern
```

Or from Elixir via a `Mob.Haptic` module that calls the NIF. Likely want a high-level `Mob.Socket.haptic/2` so screens can trigger haptics in `handle_info` without reaching for the NIF directly.

iOS: `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` / `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator`
Android: `HapticFeedbackConstants` via `View.performHapticFeedback`

**Clipboard**

```elixir
# Write
Mob.Clipboard.put(socket, "some text")  # → {:clipboard, :ok}

# Read
Mob.Clipboard.get(socket)               # → {:clipboard, :ok, "some text"} | {:clipboard, :empty}
```

iOS: `UIPasteboard.general`
Android: `ClipboardManager`

**Share sheet**

Opens the OS share dialog with a piece of content. Fire-and-forget from the BEAM's perspective.

```elixir
Mob.Share.text(socket, "Check out Mob: https://...")
Mob.Share.file(socket, "/path/to/file.pdf", mime: "application/pdf")
```

iOS: `UIActivityViewController`
Android: `Intent.ACTION_SEND`

### File picker ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

```elixir
Mob.Files.pick(socket, types: ["application/pdf"])
def handle_info({:files, :picked, items}, socket), do: ...   # items: [%{path:, name:, mime:, size:}]
def handle_info({:files, :cancelled},     socket), do: ...
```

### Motion sensors ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

```elixir
Mob.Motion.start(socket, sensors: [:accelerometer, :gyro], interval_ms: 100)
Mob.Motion.stop(socket)
def handle_info({:motion, %{accel: {ax,ay,az}, gyro: {gx,gy,gz}, timestamp: ms}}, socket), do: ...

```

iOS: `AVCaptureMetadataOutput` + `MobScannerViewController`. Android: `MobScannerActivity` with CameraX + ML Kit (requires `com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning:17.2.0` + CameraX deps).

### Notifications (local + push) ✅ Done (2026-04-15)

All notifications arrive via `handle_info` regardless of app state. When the app is killed and relaunched via a notification tap, the payload is stored at launch time and delivered after the root screen's `mount/3` completes.

**iOS setup:** In your `AppDelegate`/scene delegate, call `mob_set_launch_notification_json(json)` for remote-notification launches, and `mob_send_push_token(hexToken)` from `application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:)`.

**Android setup:** `NotificationReceiver` BroadcastReceiver handles scheduled local notifications. Push requires adding `com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging` to build.gradle and uncommenting the FCM token retrieval in `MobBridge.notify_register_push`.

---

## Notifications

Two distinct mechanisms that share the same `handle_info` shape on the BEAM side.

### Local notifications

Scheduled by the app itself — no server, no internet. Useful for reminders, timers, recurring alerts.

```elixir
# Schedule a notification
Mob.Notify.schedule(socket,
  id:      "daily_reminder",
  title:   "Time to check in",
  body:    "Open the app to see today's updates",
  at:      ~U[2026-04-16 09:00:00Z],   # or delay_seconds: 3600
  data:    %{screen: "reminders"}
)
# → {:notify, :scheduled, "daily_reminder"}

# Cancel a pending notification
Mob.Notify.cancel(socket, "daily_reminder")

# Arriving while the app is in the foreground:
def handle_info({:notification, %{id: id, data: data, source: :local}}, socket), do: ...
```

iOS: `UNUserNotificationCenter`
Android: `NotificationManager` + `AlarmManager` for scheduling

### Push notifications (mob_push)

Server-originated. Requires FCM (Android) and APNs (iOS) registration.

```elixir
# In your App start/0, request permission and subscribe to push
Mob.Notify.register_push(socket)
# → {:push_token, platform, token_string}  — send this to your server

# Arriving while app is in foreground:
def handle_info({:notification, %{title: t, body: b, data: d, source: :push}}, socket), do: ...
```

Background delivery (app not running) is handled by the OS — tapping the notification launches the app and passes `data` into `mount/3` params.

**`mob_push` package** (separate Hex package, not part of core `mob`):
- Elixir server library: `MobPush.send(token, platform, %{title: ..., body: ..., data: ...})`
- Wraps FCM HTTP v1 API (Android) and APNs HTTP/2 (iOS)
- Token storage + fanout not included — bring your own persistence

### Notification permission

Both local and push require `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+) / `UNAuthorizationOptions` (iOS). Same `Mob.Permissions` model:

```elixir
Mob.Permissions.request(socket, :notifications)
# → {:permission, :notifications, :granted | :denied}
```

---

## Phase 2

### `~MOB` sigil upgrade
Upgrade from single-element to full nested tree. Heredoc form becomes the primary way to write screens:

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  ~MOB"""
  <Column style={@screen_bg}>
    <Text style={@heading} text="Title" />
    <Text p={4} color={:gray_900} text={assigns.greeting} />
    <Button style={@btn_primary} text="Go" on_tap={{self(), :go}} />
  </Column>
  """
end
```

Single-element form stays valid for inline use. Both compile to the same node map tree.

### Generators (Igniter)
`mix mob.gen.screen`, `mix mob.gen.component`, `mix mob.gen.release` — using Igniter for idiomatic AST-aware code generation. Same infrastructure as `mix phx.gen.live`. AI agents use generators as the blessed path rather than writing from scratch.

### Physical iOS device
Needs `iproxy` (from libimobiledevice) for USB dist port tunneling:
- `iproxy 9101 9101` forwards Mac port 9101 → device port 9101 over USB
- `mob_beam.m` already reads `MOB_DIST_PORT` from env; no BEAM changes needed
- `mix mob.connect` needs to detect a plugged-in iOS device and start iproxy
- App must be signed with a development provisioning profile (free Apple account works for testing)
- `--disable-jit` flag required in BEAM args (iOS enforces W^X; JIT is blocked on device, not simulator)
- `mob_new` template needs an Xcode project or build script that accepts a signing identity
- `mix mob.gen_xcodeproj` — generate a minimal `ios/MobApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` from an EEx template using known inputs (mob_dir, OTP root, source files, bundle_id, development_team). `xcodebuild -allowProvisioningUpdates` then handles certificate/profile selection. Requires `development_team` in `mob.exs`. Would also unblock `mix mob.battery_bench_ios --native` on physical devices.

### Offline / local storage
SQLite via NIF. `Mob.Repo` with Elixir schema + migrations on app start. WAL mode default.
- Wraps `esqlite` or custom NIF (bundled SQLite `.c` file, statically linked)
- `Mob.Repo.query/2`, `Mob.Repo.transaction/2`
- Migration files in `priv/migrations/` — run on every app start, idempotent

### App Store / Play Store build pipeline
`mix mob.release --platform android|ios` — Gradle/Xcode build, signing, `.aab` / `.ipa` output. Fastlane for upload.

### Mob.Cluster

Connect Mob apps to each other — or to any Elixir/OTP node — at runtime without a server in the middle.

Two phones that share a cookie become a cluster. Every OTP primitive works across the connection: `:rpc.call`, `send` to a remote pid, distributed GenServer, global process registry. This is not a messaging protocol built on WebSockets — it is Erlang distribution, which has been doing this since 1986.

**Rendezvous options:**
- Server-mediated: both apps fetch a session cookie from your backend, call `Node.set_cookie/2` + `Node.connect/1`
- QR code: one app displays a QR containing its node name + cookie; the other scans and connects
- mDNS / local broadcast: apps discover each other on the same network without any server

**Cookie rotation:** `Node.set_cookie/2` works at runtime with no restart, so session cookies can be rotated between cluster sessions without stopping the BEAM.

**Scope:** `Mob.Cluster` is a thin API over `Node.set_cookie/2`, `Node.connect/1`, `Node.disconnect/1`, and `Mob.Dist.stop/0`. The heavy lifting is already in OTP.

```elixir
# Two phones, one line each:
Mob.Cluster.join(:"other_app@192.168.1.42", cookie: :session_abc)

# Then standard OTP across devices:
:rpc.call(:"other_app@192.168.1.42", MyApp.GameServer, :move, [:left])
```

### OTA BEAM updates (on-demand distribution)

Push new `.beam` files to installed production apps without an App Store release.

**Mechanism:** app polls an HTTP endpoint for an update manifest. When an update is available, it starts EPMD + Erlang distribution on-demand, connects outbound to the update server's BEAM node, receives new BEAMs via `:code.load_binary`, then shuts distribution back down. Distribution is never persistently open — it lives only for the duration of the update session.

```
App (on device)                     Update server (Elixir)
    │
    ├── GET /updates/check           ← signed manifest or 304
    │       {version, cookie, modules: [...]}
    │
    ├── Mob.Dist.ensure_started/1    ← start EPMD + dist on-demand
    │       (epmd_port: from manifest)
    │
    ├── Node.connect(server_node)    ← outbound connection; no open inbound port
    │
    ├── :rpc.call → :code.load_binary for each module
    │
    └── Mob.Dist.stop/0              ← shut down EPMD + dist when done
```

**Properties:**
- Phone initiates — no inbound ports need to be open on the device
- Cookie can be session-scoped (rotated per manifest) rather than static
- EPMD port configurable via manifest to avoid the 4369/adb conflict on dev machines
- Graceful fallback: if distribution fails, App Store update is still the backstop
- No App Store review for Elixir/BEAM changes (binary compatibility permitting)

**Scope:** requires `Mob.Dist.stop/0` (not yet implemented), manifest signing, and a server-side update distribution service. `mix mob.release` should produce a manifest alongside the build artifacts.

### User-defined style tokens
`MyApp.Styles` module + `mob.exs` config key. Developer defines their own color palette, type scale, spacing scale as token maps. `Mob.Renderer` merges app tokens on top of the default set at compile time.

---

## Testing and Agentic Control Strategy

The goal is full-stack observability from within the BEAM — every layer of the running
app visible and drivable programmatically, with no dependency on screenshots or
accessibility heuristics where avoidable. This serves both automated testing and
AI-assisted development workflows equally.

### What exists today

`Mob.Test` provides RPC-based control over running apps via Erlang distribution:
`screen/1`, `assigns/1`, `tap/2`, `find/2`, `navigate/2`, `select/3`,
`send_message/2`, `inspect/1`. This is already significantly more capable than
any standard mobile testing tool — exact state, no polling, no image parsing.

### Layer 1 — BEAM state (done)

Assigns, current screen, nav history, component tree. Fast, exact, no rendering
required. The primary layer for assertions.

### Layer 2 — Synthetic event injection (done)

`Mob.Test.tap/2` fires events through the same path as a real touch, via the NIF
bridge. Navigation functions are synchronous. Device API results (camera, location,
biometric, notifications) injectable via `send_message/2`.

### Layer 3 — Raw touch intercept / inject (planned)

Read every touch event that reaches the app before it is processed — finger down,
move, up, multi-touch — and expose them to the connected node. Symmetrically,
inject synthetic `UITouch` (iOS) / `MotionEvent` (Android) at the platform level,
indistinguishable from a real finger. This operates below the Mob component layer
and works even for native subviews or embedded third-party UI components.

Use cases:
- Record real user interactions as semantic event logs
- Replay recordings as regression tests stable across device sizes and OS versions
- Agent-driven interaction with any visible element regardless of whether it has a tag

### Layer 4 — Accessibility tree (planned)

Expose the platform accessibility tree (iOS `UIAccessibility`, Android
`AccessibilityNodeInfo`) to the connected node. Gives element positions, labels,
roles, and enabled/disabled state without screenshots. Complements the component
tree for native subviews and third-party UI that Mob's renderer doesn't own.

```elixir
Mob.Test.accessibility_tree(node)     # full tree
Mob.Test.find_accessible(node, "Submit")  # element by accessibility label
Mob.Test.bounds(node, :submit_button) # frame in screen coordinates
```

### Layer 5 — Visual (MCP, external)

Screenshots and accessibility dumps via `mcp__ios-simulator__*` and `mcp__adb__*`.
The layer of last resort — use when confirming layout, animations, or rendering
details that don't exist in BEAM or accessibility state. Always prefer layers 1–4
for assertions; use layer 5 for spot-checks.

### Record and replay

With layers 3 and 4 in place, a recording captures semantic intent rather than
coordinates:

```
# recorded
tap :submit  (screen: CheckoutScreen, assigns: %{form: %{valid: true}})

# not this — brittle
tap x:142 y:386
```

Recordings are dual-purpose:
- **Replay as regression test** — re-run sequence, assert assigns at each step
- **Export as ExUnit test file** — generated test a developer can commit and edit

Removes the biggest barrier to test adoption: the cost of writing them.

### Shared abstraction with Pegleg

Layers 3 and 4 (touch intercept/inject and accessibility tree) are not Mob-specific —
they operate at the NIF/platform level and apply to any iOS or Android app. When
Pegleg is built, these layers should be extracted into a shared library that both
Mob and Pegleg depend on, rather than duplicating the implementation. The Mob-specific
parts (component tree, assigns, `Mob.Test` API) stay in Mob; the platform mechanics
live in the shared layer.

---

## Nice to have

### Mob.Bluetooth + Mob.NFC

Device APIs following the same async `handle_info` pattern as `Mob.Camera` and
`Mob.Location`. NIF implementation only — no special BEAM changes required.

**`Mob.Bluetooth`** — BLE peripheral interaction (heart rate monitors, IoT
sensors, custom peripherals). iOS CoreBluetooth / Android BluetoothLE.

```elixir
Mob.Bluetooth.scan(socket)
# → {:bluetooth, :discovered, %{id: "AA:BB:...", name: "My Sensor", rssi: -62}}

Mob.Bluetooth.connect(socket, "AA:BB:...")
Mob.Bluetooth.read(socket, service_uuid, characteristic_uuid)
# → {:bluetooth, :read, %{uuid: "...", value: <<0x42>>}}
```

BLE peripheral mode (phone advertises itself) is also worth supporting — it is
a natural `Mob.Cluster` rendezvous mechanism: two phones exchange node name +
session cookie over BLE, then form an Erlang distribution cluster over TCP
without needing a server or shared WiFi network.

**`Mob.NFC`** — read/write NFC tags, peer-to-peer exchange. iOS requires a
background NFC entitlement for unsolicited reads; tag writing is more open.

```elixir
Mob.NFC.read(socket)
# → {:nfc, :tag, %{type: :ndef, records: [%{type: "text/plain", data: "hello"}]}}

Mob.NFC.write(socket, records)
# → {:nfc, :written}
```

NFC tap-to-connect is the most ergonomic `Mob.Cluster` bootstrap: tap two
phones together to exchange credentials, cluster forms automatically. Worth
implementing `Mob.Cluster` first so the NFC and BLE rendezvous flows have
something to connect to.

### Auth (`mix mob.gen.auth`)

Inspired by `mix phx.gen.auth` — a generator that scaffolds a complete auth layer for the app based on what the developer wants. Uses Igniter for AST-aware code generation so it integrates cleanly with the existing project rather than overwriting files.

**Generator interaction:**

```
$ mix mob.gen.auth

Which auth strategies do you want? (select all that apply)
  [x] Email + password
  [x] Sign in with Apple
  [x] Google Sign-In
  [ ] Phone / SMS OTP
  [ ] SSO (SAML / OIDC)

Generate session persistence? (SQLite via Mob.Repo) [Y/n]: y

This will create:
  lib/my_app/auth.ex              — Mob.Auth behaviour + strategy dispatch
  lib/my_app/screens/login.ex    — LoginScreen with selected providers
  lib/my_app/screens/register.ex — RegisterScreen (email+password only)
  priv/migrations/001_users.sql  — users table (if session persistence selected)
  config/mob.exs                 — injects auth config
```

**What it generates:**

- `LoginScreen` — pre-built screen with buttons for each selected provider, styled to platform conventions (Sign in with Apple button follows Apple HIG; Google button follows Material guidelines)
- `MyApp.Auth` module — thin wrapper around `Mob.Auth` that routes to the right strategy and handles token exchange with the developer's backend (stubbed out, ready to fill in)
- Session persistence schema if opted in — `users` table + `sessions` table via `Mob.Repo`
- Nav wiring — injects `reset_to(LoginScreen)` guard pattern into the root screen and a `logout/1` helper

**Supported strategies:**

- **Email + password** — standard login/register/forgot-password screens; developer supplies the backend verify endpoint
- **Sign in with Apple** — iOS: `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider`; Android: redirects to web OAuth (Apple doesn't provide a native Android SDK)
- **Google Sign-In** — Android: `play-services-auth`; iOS: `GoogleSignIn-iOS` SDK
- **Phone / SMS OTP** — Android: SMS Retriever API (auto-reads OTP, no permission); iOS: `ASAuthorizationPhoneNumberProvider`
- **SSO (SAML / OIDC)** — opens an in-app browser (`SFSafariViewController` / `CustomTabsIntent`) to the IdP; receives callback via deep link. Works with Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc. Deep link scheme configured in `mob.exs`.

**Uniform Elixir API** (generated code calls these; underlying NIFs do the platform work):

```elixir
Mob.Auth.sign_in_with_apple(socket)
Mob.Auth.sign_in_with_google(socket)
Mob.Auth.sign_in_with_sso(socket, url: "https://login.corp.example.com/oauth/authorize?...")
Mob.Auth.sign_in_with_phone(socket, "+16045551234")

def handle_info({:auth, provider, %{token: jwt, ...}}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:auth, :cancelled}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:auth, :error, reason}, socket), do: ...
```

The generator is opinionated about the happy path but everything it produces is plain Elixir — developers can delete the generated screens and write their own, keeping just the `Mob.Auth` NIF calls.

### In-app purchases
- iOS: StoreKit 2 (`Product.purchase()`). Async purchase flow; `handle_info` delivers result.
- Android: Google Play Billing Library (`BillingClient`).
- Unified Elixir API: `Mob.IAP.products/2`, `Mob.IAP.purchase/2`, `Mob.IAP.restore/1`.
- Consumables, non-consumables, and subscriptions all handled via same call; type is in the product definition.
- Receipt validation (server-side) is out of scope — developer calls their own backend with the token.

```elixir
Mob.IAP.products(socket, ["premium_monthly", "lifetime_unlock"])
def handle_info({:iap, :products, products}, socket), do: ...

Mob.IAP.purchase(socket, "premium_monthly")
def handle_info({:iap, :purchased, %{product_id: id, token: t}}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:iap, :cancelled}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:iap, :error, reason}, socket), do: ...
```

### Ad integration
- iOS: Google Mobile Ads SDK (`GADMobileAds`). Banner (`GADBannerView`) and interstitial (`GADInterstitialAd`).
- Android: Google Mobile Ads SDK (`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads`). Same ad unit types.
- `type: :ad_banner` component — renders a native banner ad view inline. Props: `ad_unit_id:`, `size: :banner | :large_banner | :medium_rectangle`.
- Interstitials triggered imperatively: `Mob.Ads.show_interstitial(socket, ad_unit_id: "...")`.
- Events: `{:ad, :loaded}`, `{:ad, :failed, reason}`, `{:ad, :closed}`, `{:ad, :impression}`.
- Initialisation: `Mob.Ads.init(socket, app_id: "ca-app-pub-xxx")` called once at mount.

### Crash reporting

Two distinct layers, each handling a different class of failure:

**BEAM-level crashes (pure Elixir)**

Most "crashes" in a Mob app are BEAM process exits with a structured reason and stacktrace — OTP gives you this for free. These can be captured without any native SDK:

- `Mob.Screen.terminate/2` is called on every screen process exit — hook in here to capture the reason + stacktrace
- OTP `Logger` already receives supervision tree crash reports as `:error` level messages — `Mob.NativeLogger` captures these natively, a crash reporter can also forward them
- A `Mob.CrashReporter` module (separate opt-in package) would collect these, batch them, and POST to a reporting backend over HTTP using `req` or `finch`

**Native crashes (NIF segfault, OOM kill, OS signal)**

These kill the process before the BEAM can do anything. Requires platform-native handling:

- iOS: `PLCrashReporter` (open source) or Firebase Crashlytics SDK. Signal handler writes a minidump; on next launch the app ships it.
- Android: `ApplicationExitInfo` API (Android 11+) lets you read the exit reason on next launch — covers ANRs and OOM kills without a separate SDK. For older Android + symbolicated native crashes, Crashlytics.

**Backend options (for BEAM-level reporting)**

- **Firebase Crashlytics** — free, dominant, good symbolication. Requires native SDKs on both platforms even for Elixir errors (SDK handles the upload transport). Adds native dependency weight.
- **Sentry** — has mobile SDKs but can also accept events via plain HTTP API. A self-hosted Sentry instance is achievable with Elixir and keeps all crash data on your own infrastructure. `mob_crash` (planned Hex package) would wrap the Sentry event ingest API — no native SDK needed for BEAM-level errors.
- **Custom backend** — `Mob.CrashReporter` posts structured JSON to any endpoint. Simplest for teams already running their own observability stack.

**Batteries-included goal**: `mob_crash` Hex package that works out of the box with zero config for self-hosted Sentry, and an escape hatch to configure any HTTP endpoint. Developer opts in by adding `mob_crash` to deps and calling `Mob.CrashReporter.start_link(dsn: "https://...")` in their application supervisor. No native SDK required for BEAM-level crash capture; native crash handling documented as a separate optional step.

---

### Named scroll containers + scroll events

**Problem:** Two `:scroll` nodes on the same screen have no way to be told apart, and the BEAM never hears about scroll position at all. This matters for: lazy-load triggers, hide-on-scroll headers, "back to top" buttons, analytics.

**Design:**

Add an `id` prop to `:scroll` (and generalise it as the standard identity mechanism across all interactive nodes):

```elixir
%{
  type: :scroll,
  props: %{id: :feed, on_scroll: {self(), :scrolled}},
  children: [...]
}
```

The BEAM receives scroll events as:

```elixir
def handle_info({:scroll, :feed, %{offset_y: 142.0, at_top: false, at_bottom: false}}, socket) do
  ...
end
```

**Payload fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `offset_y` | float | Vertical scroll offset in dp/pts |
| `offset_x` | float | Horizontal scroll offset (for `axis: :horizontal` scrolls) |
| `at_top` | boolean | Offset ≤ threshold (e.g. 8dp) |
| `at_bottom` | boolean | Within threshold of the bottom |
| `velocity_y` | float | Optional — scroll velocity (useful for fling detection) |

**Implementation notes:**

- iOS: `ScrollView` doesn't expose offset natively in SwiftUI; use a `GeometryReader` + `PreferenceKey` trick or `UIScrollView` delegate via `UIViewRepresentable`
- Android: `LazyColumn` scroll state is readable via `LazyListState.firstVisibleItemScrollOffset`; `nestedScroll` modifier captures velocity
- Throttle events on the native side (e.g. every 16ms / 1 frame) before sending to BEAM — raw scroll events at 60fps would flood the mailbox
- `on_scroll` is opt-in; a `:scroll` with no `on_scroll` prop costs nothing

**Generalise `id` prop across all interactive nodes:**

Currently interactive nodes use `on_tap`/`on_change` tuple tags for routing. A first-class `id` prop would be cleaner and consistent — the `id` serves as the stable routing key, and the BEAM always knows which widget fired regardless of handle churn between renders.

**Platforms:** Both (Compose `LazyListState` / `ScrollState`; SwiftUI `ScrollViewReader` / `UIScrollView` delegate)

---

## Component vocabulary

Both platforms use the same column/row layout model (Compose `Column`/`Row`, SwiftUI `VStack`/`HStack`) — the same mental model as Tailwind's flexbox. No "table" component; both platforms abandoned that in favour of styled list cells.

| Mob tag | Compose | SwiftUI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `column` | `Column` | `VStack` | ✅ done |
| `row` | `Row` | `HStack` | ✅ done |
| `box` | `Box` | `ZStack` | ✅ done |
| `scroll` | `ScrollView` + `Column` | `ScrollView` | ✅ done |
| `text` | `Text` | `Text` | ✅ done |
| `button` | `Button` | `Button` | ✅ done |
| `divider` | `HorizontalDivider` | `Divider` | ✅ done |
| `spacer` | `Spacer` (fixed size) | `Spacer` | ✅ done |
| `progress` | `LinearProgressIndicator` | `ProgressView` | ✅ done |
| `text_field` | `TextField` | `TextField` | ✅ done |
| `toggle` | `Switch` | `Toggle` | ✅ done |
| `slider` | `Slider` | `Slider` | ✅ done |
| `image` | `AsyncImage` (Coil) | `AsyncImage` | ✅ done |
| `lazy_list` | `LazyColumn` | `LazyVStack` | ✅ done |
| `list` | `LazyColumn` + swipe/sections | `List` | ⬜ planned |
| `list_section` | `stickyHeader` | `Section` | ⬜ planned |

**Spacer note:** fixed-size spacers are implemented (`size` prop in dp). Fill-available-space (flex) spacers require threading `ColumnScope`/`RowScope` context through `RenderNode` — Phase 2.

---

## Key technical constraints

1. **`enif_get_long` for color params** — ARGB 0xFFFFFFFF overflows `enif_get_int`. Always use `enif_get_long`.
2. **Cache JNI class refs in `JNI_OnLoad`** — `FindClass` fails on non-main threads. `mob_ui_cache_class(env)` caches all refs upfront.
3. **CountDownLatch needs try/finally** — if the Runnable throws, latch never fires → deadlock.
4. **`enif_keep_resource` for tap listeners** — Java holds raw ptr; GC must not free the resource.
5. **Android dist deferred 3s** — starting distribution at BEAM launch races with hwui thread pool → SIGABRT. `Mob.Dist.ensure_started/1` defers `Node.start/2` by 3 seconds.
6. **ERTS helpers as `.so` files in jniLibs** — SELinux blocks `execve` from `app_data_file`; packaging as `lib*.so` gets `apk_data_file` label which allows exec.
7. **`+C` flags invalid in `erl_start` argv** — when calling `erl_start` directly (bypassing `erlexec`), all emulator flags use `-` prefix. `+C multi_time_warp` → `-C multi_time_warp`. OTP 28+ default is already `multi_time_warp`, safe to omit.
8. **iOS OTP path** — `mob_beam.m` reads from `/tmp/otp-ios-sim`; deployer prefers that path when it exists. Cache dir (`~/.mob/cache/otp-ios-sim-XXXX/`) is fallback only.
9. **`--disable-jit` for real iOS devices** — iOS enforces W^X; JIT writes+executes memory which is blocked. Simulator builds can keep JIT. Android unaffected.
10. **Android BEAM stderr → `/dev/null`** — silent `exit(1)` from ERTS arg parse errors is the symptom. Check flags carefully; use logcat wrapper to surface boot errors.

## User-requested features (2026-04-23)

Three features requested by users: WebView, Camera preview, Audio playback. Camera recording and audio recording NIFs already exist — gaps are the camera preview component and audio playback.

### Suggested order
1. **Audio playback** ✅ Done (2026-04-24)
2. **Camera preview** ✅ Done (2026-04-24)
3. **WebView** — largest (new component + bidirectional JS bridge), do last

---

### Audio playback ✅ Done (2026-04-24)

Recording already exists (`Mob.Audio.start_recording/2`, `stop_recording/1`, result `{:audio, :recorded, %{path, duration}}`). Need playback.

**Elixir additions to `lib/mob/audio.ex`:**
```elixir
Mob.Audio.play(socket, path, opts \\ [])   # opts: loop: false, volume: 1.0
Mob.Audio.stop_playback(socket)
Mob.Audio.set_volume(socket, 0.0..1.0)     # live volume control
# Results via handle_info:
# {:audio, :playback_finished, %{path: path}}
# {:audio, :playback_error, %{reason: reason}}
```

**NIF stubs to add in `src/mob_nif.erl`:**
- `audio_play/2` (path, opts_json)
- `audio_stop_playback/0`
- `audio_set_volume/1`

**iOS (`ios/mob_nif.m`):**
- `AVAudioPlayer` for local files, `AVPlayer` for URLs/streaming
- Store player + PID in globals; `audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:` delegate sends `{:audio, :playback_finished, map}` via `enif_send`
- `AVAudioSession` category: `.playback` when playing, `.record` when recording, `.playAndRecord` when both

**Android (`android/jni/mob_nif.c` + `MobBridge.kt`):**
- `MediaPlayer` for local files (ExoPlayer for streaming — already referenced in Video stub)
- `setOnCompletionListener` callback sends result via JNI → `enif_send`

---

### Camera preview ✅ Done (2026-04-24)

Capture already exists (`Mob.Camera.capture_photo/2`, `capture_video/2`). Need a live camera feed as a UI component.

**Elixir API (`lib/mob/camera.ex` additions):**
```elixir
Mob.Camera.start_preview(socket, opts \\ [])  # opts: facing: :back | :front
Mob.Camera.stop_preview(socket)
# UI component:
Mob.UI.camera_preview(facing: :back)
```

**Component registration:**
- Add `CameraPreview` to `priv/tags/ios.txt` and `priv/tags/android.txt`
- Add `MobNodeTypeCameraPreview` to `ios/MobNode.h`

**NIF stubs:** `camera_start_preview/1`, `camera_stop_preview/0`

**iOS (`ios/mob_nif.m` + `ios/MobRootView.swift`):**
- `AVCaptureSession` + `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` wrapped in `UIViewRepresentable`
- Session managed in `mob_nif.m`; SwiftUI renders via `MobNodeTypeCameraPreview` case in `MobRootView`
- `start_preview` NIF configures + starts session; component renders the preview layer
- Permissions: requires `NSCameraUsageDescription` in `Info.plist` (already in generated template)

**Android (`android/jni/mob_nif.c` + `MobBridge.kt`):**
- CameraX `PreviewView` embedded via Compose `AndroidView`
- `ProcessCameraProvider` binds preview use case in `MobBridge`
- NIF calls JNI bridge to start/stop

---

### Mob.Storage ✅ Done (2026-04-24)

Platform-agnostic file management. `dir/1` is the only NIF (path resolution); all other
operations delegate to `File.*` which works fine on the device's native FS.

**`lib/mob/storage.ex`** — cross-platform:
```elixir
Mob.Storage.dir(:temp | :documents | :cache | :app_support)  # → absolute path string
Mob.Storage.list(path_or_atom)   # → {:ok, [full_paths]} | {:error, :enoent}
Mob.Storage.stat(path)           # → {:ok, %{name:, path:, size:, modified_at:}} | error
Mob.Storage.read(path)           # → {:ok, binary} | {:error, reason}
Mob.Storage.write(path, data)    # → {:ok, path} | {:error, reason}
Mob.Storage.delete(path)         # → :ok | {:error, reason}
Mob.Storage.copy(src, dest)      # dest may be atom location or full path → {:ok, dest}
Mob.Storage.move(src, dest)      # dest may be atom location or full path → {:ok, dest}
Mob.Storage.extension(path)      # → ".mp4" | "" — explicit, zero I/O cost
```

No `type` field in `stat` — platforms don't record content type as a file attribute for sandbox files. Use `extension/1` explicitly instead.

**`lib/mob/storage/apple.ex`** — iOS/iPadOS-specific:
```elixir
Mob.Storage.Apple.dir(:temp | :documents | :cache | :app_support | :icloud)
# Returns nil for :icloud when iCloud Drive is not configured

Mob.Storage.Apple.save_to_photo_library(socket, path)
# Uses PHPhotoLibrary + PHAccessLevelAddOnly (no full library read permission needed)
# Result via handle_info: {:storage, :saved_to_library, path} | {:storage, :error, :save_to_library, reason}
```

**`lib/mob/storage/android.ex`** — Android-specific:
```elixir
Mob.Storage.Android.external_files_dir(:documents | :pictures | :music | :movies | :downloads | :dcim)
# Maps to Environment.DIRECTORY_* constants via getExternalFilesDir — no permission needed

Mob.Storage.Android.save_to_media_store(socket, path, :auto | :image | :video | :audio)
# Uses ContentValues + IS_PENDING pattern (API 29+, no permission needed for own files)
# Result via handle_info: {:storage, :saved_to_library, path} | {:storage, :error, :save_to_library, reason}
```

**`mix mob.enable` integration:** `file_sharing` feature adds `UIFileSharingEnabled` (iOS) and `FileProvider` (Android) to manifests. `photo_library` adds `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` (iOS) / no permission needed (Android 29+).

**Tests:** `test/mob/storage_test.exs` — 21 tests covering all public functions except `dir/1` (NIF-dependent). Uses real temp directories with `on_exit` cleanup. No mocks.

---

### WebView ✅ Done (2026-04-24)

Fully new: UI component + bidirectional JS bridge. Two distinct use cases:
1. **Standalone WebView** — point at any external URL (company intranet, third-party service)
2. **LiveView mode** — point at a local Phoenix endpoint for server-rendered UI with near-zero latency

**Elixir API (`lib/mob/webview.ex` — new file):**
```elixir
# UI component
Mob.UI.webview(
  url:      "https://...",
  allow:    ["https://example.com", "https://api.example.com"],  # URL whitelist
  show_url: false,    # show native URL label above webview (default: false)
  title:    nil       # static title label above webview (overrides show_url)
)

# JS bridge — eval and message passing
Mob.WebView.eval_js(socket, "document.title")
Mob.WebView.post_message(socket, %{event: "data", payload: payload})
# Results via handle_info:
# {:webview, :message, %{"event" => "...", ...}}   ← JS called window.mob.send(data)
# {:webview, :eval_result, result}                  ← eval callback
# {:webview, :blocked, url}                         ← blocked URL navigation attempt
```

**URL whitelist:**
- `allow:` prop encodes permitted origins in node props
- Enforced natively in `WKNavigationDelegate` (iOS) / `WebViewClient` (Android)
- Blocked URLs fire `{:webview, :blocked, url}` via `handle_info`; page stays on current URL
- Empty `allow:` list = allow everything (default)

**History-aware back navigation:**
- Two new NIFs: `webview_can_go_back/0` → boolean, `webview_go_back/0`
- `Mob.Screen` default back handler checks `webview_can_go_back()` first; navigates WebView history before popping Mob nav stack
- Native back gesture (iOS edge swipe, Android back button) respects WebView internal history automatically
- No special handling needed for dead views — works with normal `Mob.Screen` back behavior

**URL bar visibility:**
- No native browser chrome by default — URL bar hidden, nav buttons hidden
- `show_url: true` adds a native label above the WebView showing current URL
- `title: "My App"` adds a static label (takes precedence over `show_url`)
- Users cannot accidentally navigate away unless explicitly enabled

**JS bridge — platform-identical via LiveView WebSocket:**
- Do NOT use `window.webkit.messageHandlers` (iOS-only) or `window.MobBridge` (Android-only)
- Instead: inject a tiny shim that uses `this.pushEvent` / `this.handleEvent` (LiveView hooks) over the existing WebSocket connection
- Bridge is 100% platform-identical — no conditional code in user's JS
- Works for both standalone WebView (shim injected into page) and LiveView mode (hooks native)

```javascript
// Injected shim (same on both platforms):
window.mob = {
  send: (data) => liveViewHook.pushEvent("webview_message", data),
  onMessage: (handler) => liveViewHook.handleEvent("webview_push", handler)
};
```

**NIF stubs:** `webview_eval_js/1`, `webview_post_message/1`, `webview_can_go_back/0`, `webview_go_back/0`

**iOS (`ios/mob_nif.m` + `ios/MobRootView.swift`):**
- `WKWebView` in `UIViewRepresentable`
- `WKNavigationDelegate` enforces `allow:` whitelist, fires blocked event
- `evaluateJavaScript:completionHandler:` for `eval_js`
- Store `WKWebView` ref + PID in globals; `webViewCanGoBack/webViewGoBack` read from global ref

**Android (`android/jni/mob_nif.c` + `MobBridge.kt`):**
- `android.webkit.WebView` + `WebViewClient` via Compose `AndroidView`
- `WebViewClient.shouldOverrideUrlLoading` enforces whitelist, fires blocked event
- `evaluateJavascript(code, callback)` for `eval_js`
- `webView.canGoBack()` / `webView.goBack()` for history NIFs

**Component vocabulary table addition:**
| `webview` | `WebView` | `WKWebView` | ✅ done |
| `camera_preview` | `PreviewView` | `AVCapturePreviewLayer` | ✅ done |

---

### LiveView mode ✅ Done

**The idea:** BEAM is already on the device → start a local Phoenix endpoint → WebView points
at `http://localhost:PORT` → full LiveView with near-zero latency (loopback, no network).

Web developers can ship a mobile app by writing zero native UI code. Phoenix generators
work unchanged. The JS bridge via LiveView WebSocket means the same hooks work on both
platforms identically.

**Enabling LiveView mode:**
```bash
# New project (generates Phoenix project with Mob sidecar)
mix mob.new myapp --mode liveview

# Add to existing Phoenix project
mix mob.enable liveview
```

**What `mix mob.enable liveview` does:**
- Adds `mob` to `mix.exs` deps
- Generates `lib/myapp/mob.ex` — `Mob.LiveView` supervision module that starts Phoenix endpoint + Mob runtime
- Adds `MobScreen` to `application.ex` children
- Injects JS bridge shim into `assets/js/app.js` (LiveView hook registration)
- Writes `mob.exs` with `mode: :liveview` and `port: 4001`

**Architecture:**
```
Device BEAM → Phoenix.Endpoint (localhost:4001) → LiveView WebSocket
                                                 → WebView (Mob UI component)
```

The WebView renders the Phoenix app. LiveView updates propagate over WebSocket with sub-5ms latency (loopback). No Cloudflare, no network.

**Weight analysis:**
- Phoenix framework: ~3MB of .beam files (hot-pushed, not bundled in APK)
- Cowboy HTTP server: ~1MB
- Total overhead vs bare Mob: ~4-5MB of .beam files
- APK/IPA size: same (BEAMs are pushed at runtime, not bundled)
- Worth it for teams already writing Phoenix — zero new concepts

**Phoenix generators in LiveView mode:**
- Standard `mix phx.gen.live` generators work unchanged — they generate regular LiveViews
- Mob adds two new generators for Mob-specific integration:
  - `mix mob.gen.live_screen` — generates a LiveView that's aware of the Mob WebView lifecycle (safe area, back gesture, etc.)
  - `mix mob.gen.sync` — generates a GenServer + migration for PostgreSQL→SQLite sync (see below)
- No reason to change what Phoenix generators do — user's server and app share the same LiveView code

**Dead views:** Work fine. A LiveView rendered in a Mob WebView behaves like any LiveView. The only special case is WebView internal history vs Mob nav stack — solved by `webview_can_go_back` NIF (see WebView section).

**PostgreSQL→SQLite sync story:**
- Server stays on PostgreSQL (all users)
- Device SQLite starts empty on first launch
- On login: sync the logged-in user's data slice from PostgreSQL → SQLite
- `mix mob.gen.sync` generates the sync GenServer + Ecto schemas for both databases
- This is NOT a migration — it's a one-user data copy at session start
- Offline reads use SQLite; writes go to the server + update SQLite optimistically
- Only makes sense for apps with well-bounded per-user data (warehouse inventory per user, not social feeds)

---

### `mix mob.enable` — multi-feature task ✅ Done

Currently `mix mob.enable` takes a single feature. Should accept multiple:

```bash
mix mob.enable camera photo_library file_sharing liveview
```

**What it does per feature:**

| Feature | iOS (Info.plist) | Android (AndroidManifest.xml) |
|---|---|---|
| `camera` | `NSCameraUsageDescription` (prompts for string) | `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>` |
| `photo_library` | `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` (prompts for string) | none needed (API 29+) |
| `file_sharing` | `UIFileSharingEnabled`, `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` | `<provider android:name="FileProvider">` |
| `location` | `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` (prompts for string) | `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` |
| `notifications` | runtime only (no plist key) | `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (API 33+) |
| `media_store` | n/a | none needed (API 29+ own files) |
| `liveview` | (handled separately — see LiveView mode) | (same) |

**Implementation:**
- iOS: structured XML editing of `Info.plist` using regex or `xmerl` — idempotent, won't duplicate existing entries; prompts developer for usage description strings if not already set
- Android: line-by-line insert of `<uses-permission>` before `</manifest>` close — idempotent check for existing entries first
- All selections stored in `mob.exs` under `:capabilities` key (same as capability wizard design)
- Task validates that requested features are known; warns on unknown atoms

## Feature parity — Flutter / React Native gaps

Features that Flutter and React Native ship out of the box that Mob is missing. Grouped by area; ordered roughly by how badly a missing item blocks a real app.

---

### Overlays & feedback

**`alert` ⬜**
Native system alert dialog with title, message, and buttons. `UIAlertController` (iOS) / `AlertDialog` (Android). Every app needs this — confirmation dialogs, error messages, destructive-action prompts.
```elixir
Mob.Alert.show(socket, title: "Delete?", message: "This cannot be undone",
  buttons: [ok: "Delete", cancel: "Cancel"])
def handle_info({:alert, :ok},     socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:alert, :cancel}, socket), do: ...
```

**`bottom_sheet` ⬜**
Modal sheet that slides up from the bottom. iOS: `UISheetPresentationController` (half/full detents). Android: `ModalBottomSheet`. Used for contextual actions, pickers, secondary flows.
```elixir
Mob.Sheet.show(socket, detents: [:medium, :large]) do
  # rendered as a Mob screen tree
end
```

**`action_sheet` ⬜**
List of labelled actions presented as a sheet (iOS) or bottom dialog (Android). For "Share / Edit / Delete" menus. Shares the `Mob.Sheet` or `Mob.Alert` namespace.
```elixir
Mob.ActionSheet.show(socket, title: "Options",
  actions: [share: "Share", edit: "Edit", delete: [label: "Delete", destructive: true]])
def handle_info({:action_sheet, :delete}, socket), do: ...
```

**`toast` / snackbar ⬜**
Brief ephemeral message overlaid on content, auto-dismissed after N seconds. Android: `Snackbar`. iOS: no native equivalent — custom implementation needed.
```elixir
Mob.Toast.show(socket, "Saved!", duration: :short)               # fire and forget
Mob.Toast.show(socket, "Undo?", action: [label: "Undo", tag: :undo])
def handle_info({:toast, :undo}, socket), do: ...
```

**`activity_indicator` (circular spinner) ⬜**
Circular indefinite progress spinner. `UIActivityIndicatorView` (iOS) / `CircularProgressIndicator` (Android). Linear `progress` already exists; circular is just as common.
```elixir
%{type: :spinner, props: %{size: :large, color: :primary}}
```

**`date_picker` / `time_picker` ⬜**
Native date and time selection UI. iOS: `UIDatePicker` (wheel or inline calendar). Android: `DatePickerDialog` / `TimePickerDialog`. Both platforms have strong, expected visual conventions.
```elixir
%{type: :date_picker, props: %{value: assigns.date, mode: :date, on_change: {self(), :date}}}
# mode: :date | :time | :datetime
def handle_info({:change, :date, ~D[2026-01-15]}, socket), do: ...
```

**`picker` / `select` ⬜**
Single-value selection from a list. iOS: spinning wheel (`UIPickerView`). Android: dropdown (`DropdownMenu` / `Spinner`). Essential for any form with enumerated choices.
```elixir
%{type: :picker, props: %{
  options: [{"Red", :red}, {"Green", :green}],
  value: assigns.color,
  on_change: {self(), :color}
}}
```

**`checkbox` ⬜**
Boolean input with tri-state support (checked / unchecked / indeterminate). Semantically different from `toggle` — multi-select lists, terms-and-conditions, etc.
```elixir
%{type: :checkbox, props: %{checked: assigns.agreed, label: "I agree", on_change: {self(), :agreed}}}
```

**`segmented_control` / `radio` ⬜**
Mutually exclusive selection from 2–5 options. iOS: `UISegmentedControl`. Android: `RadioGroup` or segmented `FilterChip`. Common for filter bars, view-mode switchers.
```elixir
%{type: :segmented_control, props: %{
  options: [{"Day", :day}, {"Week", :week}, {"Month", :month}],
  value: assigns.period,
  on_change: {self(), :period}
}}
```

**`search_bar` ⬜**
Native search input. iOS: `UISearchController` with a very specific appearance that users expect (integrated with navigation bar). Android: `SearchView` or Material search bar.
```elixir
%{type: :search_bar, props: %{placeholder: "Search...", value: assigns.query, on_change: {self(), :query}}}
```

**Multiline `text_field` ⬜**
Current `text_field` is single-line. Text area / multiline input needed for notes, messages, descriptions. Both platforms support this via the same component — just a `multiline: true` prop and a `min_height` / `max_height`.
```elixir
%{type: :text_field, props: %{multiline: true, min_height: 80, max_lines: 10}}
```

---

### App lifecycle & system integration

**App foreground / background events ⬜**
`UIApplicationDelegate` (iOS) / `ProcessLifecycleObserver` (Android) → `handle_info` events. Essential for: pausing audio/video on background, refreshing auth tokens on foreground, saving drafts.
```elixir
def handle_info({:app, :background}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:app, :foreground}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:app, :inactive},   socket), do: ...   # iOS only (incoming call, etc.)
```

**Deep linking / URL scheme handling ⬜**
App receives a URL (custom scheme `myapp://` or universal link `https://myapp.com/...`) and routes to the correct screen. Essential for OAuth redirects, push notification taps, share links, QR-code-to-app flows.
```elixir
# In mob.exs: url_scheme: "myapp"
def handle_info({:deep_link, "myapp://items/42"}, socket), do: ...
```
iOS: `UIApplicationDelegate.application(_:open:options:)` + Associated Domains for universal links.
Android: `<intent-filter>` with `android:scheme` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

**Keyboard avoidance ⬜**
When the software keyboard appears over a `text_field`, content below it gets obscured. Without automatic avoidance, form screens are unusable on many device sizes. React Native: `KeyboardAvoidingView`. Flutter: `Scaffold.resizeToAvoidBottomInset`.

iOS: `NotificationCenter` `keyboardWillShowNotification` → adjust scroll offset or bottom padding.
Android: `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` + `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` → adjust bottom inset.
BEAM receives `{:keyboard, :will_show, %{height: h}}` / `{:keyboard, :will_hide}` so screens can adjust layout.

---

### Device state

**Network connectivity ⬜**
Online/offline status and connection type (WiFi / cellular / none). Needed for offline-first apps, showing "no connection" banners, gating network calls.
```elixir
Mob.Network.start(socket)   # subscribe to changes
def handle_info({:network, :online,  :wifi},     socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:network, :online,  :cellular}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:network, :offline},             socket), do: ...
```
iOS: `NWPathMonitor`. Android: `ConnectivityManager` + `NetworkCallback`.

**Device info ⬜**
Synchronous read of static device properties. Needed constantly for analytics, layout decisions (tablet vs phone), locale-aware formatting.
```elixir
Mob.Device.info()
# %{model: "iPhone 16 Pro", os: :ios, os_version: "18.4", locale: "en-CA",
#   timezone: "America/Vancouver", screen: %{width: 393, height: 852, scale: 3.0},
#   form_factor: :phone | :tablet}
```

---

### Layout

**Flex / expand (fill available space) ⬜**
A child that stretches to fill remaining space in a `column` or `row`. The single most common layout primitive after basic stacking. Currently Mob only has fixed-size `spacer`.
```elixir
%{type: :row, children: [
  %{type: :text, props: %{text: "Label"}},
  %{type: :spacer},                            # flex: 1 — fills remaining width
  %{type: :button, props: %{text: "Action"}}
]}
```
iOS: `Spacer()` in HStack already does this; need to wire `spacer` with no `size` prop to it.
Android: `Modifier.weight(1f)` on the child composable.

**`wrap` layout ⬜**
A row that wraps children to the next line when they overflow. Used for tag chips, filter pills, multi-select badge lists.
```elixir
%{type: :wrap, props: %{spacing: 8, run_spacing: 8}, children: tag_chips}
```
iOS: `FlowLayout` (iOS 16+) or manual `GeometryReader` + `LazyVGrid` workaround.
Android: `FlowRow` (Compose 1.5+).

**Absolute positioning ⬜**
Position a child at exact coordinates within a `box` (ZStack). Needed for overlay badges, floating action buttons, custom tooltips, notification dots on icons.
```elixir
%{type: :box, children: [
  content_node,
  %{type: :text, props: %{text: "3", position: %{top: 0, right: 0}}}
]}
```
Both platforms: already have ZStack / Box — just need `position:` prop wired through.

**`badge` ⬜**
Numeric or dot badge overlaid on a tab bar item or icon. Native `TabBar` badge on iOS; Compose `BadgedBox` on Android. Also achievable with absolute positioning, but platform-native badges match OS conventions exactly.
```elixir
# In tab_bar tabs list:
%{id: :inbox, label: "Inbox", icon: :envelope, badge: assigns.unread_count}
```

---

### Gestures

**Long press on arbitrary nodes ⬜**
`on_long_press:` prop analogous to `on_tap:`. Needed for context menus, drag-to-reorder initiation, custom interactions. Fire-and-forget from native → `{:long_press, tag}` in `handle_info`.
```elixir
%{type: :button, props: %{text: "Hold me", on_long_press: {self(), :hold}}}
def handle_info({:long_press, :hold}, socket), do: ...
```

**Pinch / pan gestures ⬜**
Scale and translate gestures. Needed for zoomable images, custom drawing surfaces, map-like UIs. Delivered as continuous events with scale factor and translation delta.
```elixir
%{type: :image, props: %{src: "...", on_pinch: {self(), :zoom}, on_pan: {self(), :pan}}}
def handle_info({:pinch, :zoom, %{scale: 1.4}}, socket), do: ...
def handle_info({:pan,   :pan,  %{dx: 10.0, dy: 0.0}}, socket), do: ...
```

**Drag and drop / reorderable lists ⬜**
List items that can be reordered by dragging. iOS: `onMove` modifier on `List`. Android: `ReorderableLazyColumn` (Compose). Delivered as `{:reorder, id, from_index, to_index}`.

---

### Media & graphics

**Map component ⬜**
Embed a native map with pins and overlays. iOS: `MapKit` (no API key required). Android: Google Maps SDK or OpenStreetMap / MapLibre (no mandatory Google dependency).
```elixir
%{type: :map, props: %{
  region: %{lat: 49.28, lon: -123.12, span_lat: 0.05, span_lon: 0.05},
  pins: [%{lat: 49.28, lon: -123.12, title: "HQ", tag: :hq}],
  on_pin_tap: {self(), :pin}
}}
def handle_info({:tap, {:pin, :hq}}, socket), do: ...
```

**SVG rendering ⬜**
Render vector graphics from SVG source. Needed for design-system icons, charts, illustrations. iOS: no built-in SVG renderer — requires a third-party library (e.g. SVGKit or a WKWebView trick). Android: `VectorDrawable` or `AndroidSVG`.

**Lottie animations ⬜**
JSON-based animation files from Adobe After Effects. Very common for onboarding screens, empty states, success/error animations. Both platforms have official Lottie SDKs.
```elixir
%{type: :lottie, props: %{src: "priv/animations/success.json", loop: false, autoplay: true}}
```

**Canvas / custom painting ⬜**
Low-level 2D drawing API. Flutter's strongest suit (`CustomPainter`). Needed for charts, custom gauges, drawing apps, anything that doesn't fit the component model. iOS: `CoreGraphics` via `UIViewRepresentable`. Android: `Canvas` via `drawBehind` modifier or `AndroidView`.

---

### Lists (Phase 2 unblocks)

These are already noted as Phase 2 in the list component section but called out here for completeness since they're table-stakes in Flutter/RN:

- **Pull to refresh** — `on_refresh` + `refreshing:` props on `list`; `SwipeRefresh` (Android) / `.refreshable` (iOS)
- **Swipe actions** — `swipe_left` / `swipe_right` on `list_item`
- **List sections** — `list_section` with sticky headers
- **Lazy grid** — `lazy_grid` component; `LazyVerticalGrid` (Android) / `LazyVGrid` (iOS). Photo galleries, product grids.

---

### Rich text

**Inline text spans ⬜**
Bold a word within a sentence, inline links, mixed colors/sizes in one block. iOS: `AttributedString`. Android: `AnnotatedString`. Needed for chat messages, formatted content, markdown rendering.
```elixir
%{type: :rich_text, spans: [
  %{text: "Hello ", weight: :regular},
  %{text: "world",  weight: :bold, color: :primary},
  %{text: "!"}
]}
```

**Selectable text ⬜**
Allow users to select and copy text. Mobile default is non-selectable. iOS: `.textSelection(.enabled)`. Android: `SelectionContainer`. Needed for any content the user might want to copy (addresses, codes, logs).

---

### Platform conventions

**Dark mode ⬜**
Dynamic color based on system appearance (`UIUserInterfaceStyle` / `isSystemInDarkTheme()`). Apps that ignore dark mode look unfinished to iOS/Android users. Two approaches:
- Semantic color tokens (`:primary`, `:background`) resolve to different ARGB values in light vs dark — preferred, no code change at the screen level
- `Mob.Theme.mode/0` → `:light | :dark` for manual branching

**Accessibility labels ⬜**
`accessibility_label:`, `accessibility_hint:`, `accessibility_role:` props on all interactive nodes. Required for VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android). Also needed for `Mob.Test.find/2` to work reliably on elements without visible text.

**Dynamic type ⬜**
iOS scales all text with the user's preferred font size setting (`UIFontMetrics`). Android does the same (`sp` units already scale, but line heights and container sizes need to adapt). Ignoring this is an accessibility gap — text becomes unreadably small or layout breaks for users who have increased their system font size.

**RTL layout ⬜**
Right-to-left language support (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu). Start/end instead of left/right for padding, alignment, and icon placement. iOS and Android both handle most RTL automatically when the locale is RTL — Mob needs to pass semantic direction through rather than hardcoding pixel directions.

## Native event surface — `Mob.Device` + UI events

**Goal:** every meaningful OS / UI event surfaces to Elixir as a tagged tuple
following the `Mob.Device` model: NIF observes natively, emits
`{:mob_device, atom}` (cross-platform) and/or `{:mob_device_<plat>, atom, payload}`
(platform-specific) to a registered dispatcher pid which fans out to subscribers
by category.

### Batch 1 — Device lifecycle ⏳ (in progress)

iOS + Android. Six categories: `:app`, `:display`, `:audio`, `:power`,
`:thermal`, `:memory`. ~30 events total. Low-frequency, no throttling needed.
Foundation for `Mob.Device.subscribe/1` and `Mob.Device.IOS` / `Mob.Device.Android`.

### Batch 2 — Audit existing widget events ✅ (Elixir side)

**Shipped:**
- `guides/event_model.md` — full event model design doc (canonical envelope,
  Address struct, target resolution, stateful vs stateless components, ID
  type rules, atom-exhaustion warning, migration path)
- `guides/event_audit.md` — current state of native emitters, mapping to new
  envelope, pending native work
- `Mob.Event.Address` — typed address struct with validation, formatters,
  pattern-matching helpers (47 tests + 10 doctests)
- `Mob.Event.Target` — target resolution covering `:parent`, `:screen`,
  `{:component, id}`, atom, pid, `{:via, mod, key}` (17 tests + 3 doctests)
- `Mob.Event` — emit/dispatch API, envelope predicate, address matcher,
  test helper (20 tests + 4 doctests)
- `Mob.Event.Bridge` — converts legacy `{:tap, tag}`, `{:change, tag, value}`,
  `{:tap, {:list, id, :select, idx}}` into canonical envelope (19 tests + 4 doctests)

### Batch 3 — Low-frequency widget events ✅ (Elixir + iOS) / ⏳ (Android JNI)

**Shipped:**
- Existing: `on_change`, `on_focus`, `on_blur`, `on_submit`, `on_end_reached`,
  `on_tab_select` already wired
- New: `on_select` for pickers/menus/segmented controls — renderer + iOS NIF +
  iOS `MobNode` property + iOS prop deserialiser; Android C sender exported
  via `mob_beam.h`
- Bridge handles `{:change, tag, value}` shape conversion to canonical

**Pending:** Android JNI stubs in `beam_jni.c`; Compose `Modifier` for
`on_select`.

### Batch 4 — Gestures ✅ (Elixir + iOS) / ⏳ (Android JNI)

**Shipped:**
- Renderer: `on_long_press`, `on_double_tap`, `on_swipe`, `on_swipe_left`,
  `on_swipe_right`, `on_swipe_up`, `on_swipe_down` props
- iOS: NIF senders (`mob_send_long_press`, `mob_send_double_tap`,
  `mob_send_swipe_*`, `mob_send_swipe_with_direction`); `MobNode` properties;
  prop deserialiser; SwiftUI `View.mobGestures(_:)` modifier with
  `.onLongPressGesture`, `.onTapGesture(count: 2)`, conditional `DragGesture`
  (only attached when at least one swipe handler is set, to avoid
  ScrollView interference)
- Android: C sender functions and `mob_beam.h` exports

**Pending:**
- Android JNI stubs in `beam_jni.c` calling the C senders
- Kotlin `MobBridge` JNI declarations
- Compose `Modifier.pointerInput { detectTapGestures, detectDragGestures }`
  setup in the generated app
- Physical-device verification of iOS swipe-vs-scroll conflict resolution

**Not yet started:**
- Stateful `Mob.List` migration to the new event model — keeping current
  shape working via the bridge for now; full migration when the
  stateful-component infrastructure (`Mob.Event.Component`) lands.

### Batch 5 — High-frequency events ✅ (Elixir + iOS) / ⏳ (Android JNI)

`on_scroll`, `on_drag`, `on_pinch`, `on_rotate`, `on_pointer_move`. These
fire 60–120 Hz natively. The design (lessons from React Native + Flutter):
**three tiers, each appropriate for a different category of use case.**

#### Tier 1 — NIF-side throttled stream

Raw scroll events to BEAM, but throttled and delta-thresholded native-side
*before* the `enif_send`. Default cap 30 Hz; configurable per widget:

```elixir
on_scroll: {pid, :main_list}                  # 30 Hz default
on_scroll: {pid, :main_list, throttle: 100}   # 10 Hz
on_scroll: {pid, :main_list, throttle: 0}     # raw 60-120 Hz, escape hatch
on_scroll: {pid, :main_list, debounce: 200}   # only after scroll stops
```

Native side maintains per-handle state: `last_emit_ts`, `last_emit_x/y`,
`throttle_ms`, `delta_threshold`. Cheap rejection before any BEAM crossing.

Envelope:
```elixir
{:mob_event, addr, :scroll, %{
  x: 0, y: 1240, dx: 0, dy: 12,
  velocity_x: 0.0, velocity_y: 720.0,
  phase: :began | :dragging | :decelerating | :ended,
  ts: 18472, seq: 891
}}
```

`seq` is a monotonic counter so handlers detect drops; `ts` is monotonic ms
since render started; `phase` lets handlers cheaply ignore the dragging
stream and react only to begin/end.

#### Tier 2 — Semantic events (no per-frame data)

Most code wants *meaningful* events about scroll, not the position stream:

```elixir
on_scroll_began:    :tag                              # touch went down
on_scroll_ended:    :tag                              # finger lifted
on_scroll_settled:  :tag                              # all motion stopped
on_end_reached:     :tag                              # bottom (already wired)
on_top_reached:     :tag                              # top
on_scrolled_past:   {:tag, threshold_y}               # crossed a y-pixel boundary
```

Each fires *once per event*, never floods the mailbox. The 95% case
(pagination, hiding a button when scrolled, fading a header below 100 px)
uses these and never opts into Tier 1 at all.

#### Tier 3 — Native-side scroll-driven UI primitives

Some scroll behaviors *must* run at display refresh rate without round-trips:
parallax, sticky-with-interpolation headers, fading navbars. These are
*native props* on widgets. The native side wires them directly using
SwiftUI's `.scrollPosition` observer (iOS 17+) and Compose's `snapshotFlow`.
Zero BEAM involvement during the scroll.

```elixir
%{type: :image, props: %{
  src: "hero.jpg",
  parallax: %{ratio: 0.5, container: :main_scroll}
}}

%{type: :navbar, props: %{
  fade_on_scroll: %{container: :main_scroll, fade_after: 100, fade_over: 60}
}}

%{type: :header, props: %{
  sticky_when_scrolled_past: %{container: :main_scroll, threshold: 200}
}}
```

This is the React Native `useNativeDriver` lesson applied to Mob: keep the
60 Hz pipeline native; let BEAM see only the *result* (e.g. "user reached
sticky state"). New Tier-3 props are added on demand, not designed
speculatively.

**Other high-frequency events** — `on_drag`, `on_pinch`, `on_rotate`,
`on_pointer_move` — get the same Tier 1 throttling treatment. Pointer move
is the most aggressive (constant cursor movement on iPad trackpad / Android
tablet) and may need stricter defaults.

**Shipped:**
- `Mob.Event.Throttle` — config parser/validator (parse / default_for /
  default? helpers). Per-event-kind defaults: scroll 33 ms / 1 px, drag
  16 ms / 1 px, pinch 16 ms / 0.01, rotate 16 ms / 1°, pointer_move
  33 ms / 4 px. (33 tests + 6 doctests)
- `Mob.Event.Bridge` extended for HF event shapes
  (`:scroll`/`:drag`/`:pinch`/`:rotate`/`:pointer_move` with payload maps,
  plus 5 Tier-2 single-fires).
- Renderer prop pass-through for all Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 props with
  config encoding for native consumption.
- iOS: native throttle state per TapHandle; `mob_send_scroll`,
  `mob_send_drag`, `mob_send_pinch`, `mob_send_rotate`,
  `mob_send_pointer_move`, plus 5 Tier-2 senders. Throttle/delta gating
  before any `enif_send`. Phase-boundary events (`began`/`ended`) bypass
  throttling. SwiftUI `MobScrollObserver` modifier (iOS 17+) wires
  `onScrollGeometryChange` to the node closures; debounced timer derives
  `scroll_ended`/`scroll_settled`. Tier-3 native config props are
  pass-through dictionaries on `MobNode` for the SwiftUI layer to read.
- Android: same C senders (`mob_send_scroll` / `_drag` / `_pinch` /
  `_rotate` / `_pointer_move` / Tier-2 single-fires). `clock_gettime`
  monotonic time. Header exports in `mob_beam.h`.
- Tests: 27 throttle + 36 bridge + 16 integration + 14 renderer scroll/HF
  cases; total suite 563 / 0 failures.

**Pending:**
- Android JNI stubs in `beam_jni.c` calling the C senders.
- Compose `Modifier.scrollable` / `LazyListState`-`snapshotFlow` wiring in
  the generated app's MobBridge to actually fire `mob_send_scroll`.
- Tier 3 native primitives — only the prop-pass-through is wired today;
  the SwiftUI side that *applies* parallax/fade/sticky transforms is the
  next addition (small per-primitive — added on demand).
- Physical-device perf verification of the 30 Hz scroll cap; tune
  defaults if real-world apps need different fidelity.

**Performance note for batches 1–4 vs 5–6:** batches 1–4 are essentially free —
each event takes one `dispatch_async` + one `enif_send`, ~1–10 μs at <10 Hz.
Batch 5 needs careful native-side gating: 60 Hz scroll events on multiple
lists can become hundreds of `enif_send` calls per second per subscriber.

### Batch 6 — IME composition ✅ (Elixir + foundation) / ⏳ (platform-side observers)

Of the originally-planned Batch 6 surface (drag-and-drop, IME, multi-touch,
stylus, hover), only **IME composition** ships now. The others are deferred
to Batch 7 — see speculative design below.

**Why IME ships now:** text fields already exist; CJK / Korean / Vietnamese
users SEE composition working (UIKit/Compose handle it natively), but apps
that read partial input during composition (search-as-you-type, network
sync) get garbled non-final text without observation. Not "wait for asks."

**Shipped:**
- `on_compose: {pid, tag}` prop on text fields. Phase atom is
  `:began | :updating | :committed | :cancelled`. Payload is
  `%{text: binary, phase: atom}`.
- `Mob.Event.Bridge` recognises `{:compose, tag, %{phase: ...}}` and
  validates the phase atom.
- iOS NIF: `mob_send_compose(handle, text, phase)`; `MobNode.onCompose`
  closure property; prop deserialiser wires it; SwiftUI side fires nothing
  yet (see "Pending" below).
- Android NIF: same C-side sender; header export.
- Tests: 8 bridge tests, 1 renderer test, 3 integration tests including a
  full commit-only filter pattern (CJK simulation: keystrokes during
  composition + final commit, asserts only committed text is delivered).

**Pending:**
- iOS SwiftUI: real composition observation requires a `UIViewRepresentable`
  wrapping `UITextField` with a delegate that watches `markedTextRange` /
  `setMarkedText:`. Tracked separately — the existing `MobTextField` is
  SwiftUI-based and doesn't expose marked-text state.
- Android: Compose `TextFieldValue.composition` range observation in the
  generated app's `MobBridge`, calling `mob_send_compose` via JNI.
- Until both ship, the Elixir contract works (events deliver if the native
  side calls `mob_send_compose`) but no native source emits them yet.

### Batch 7 — Niche surfaces (deferred — implement on demand) ⬜

The following sub-items from the original Batch 6 are **deferred until a
real app needs them**. They each require design choices that are easier to
make with a concrete use case to validate against, and each represents
significant native + Elixir work that isn't justified by current users.

#### Drag-and-drop

**Use cases that justify implementation:** kanban boards (reorder cards
between columns), file drop zones (chat attachments, photo upload), todo
list reordering, draggable widgets in a layout editor.

**Speculative API:**

```elixir
# Source — declares what can be dragged from this widget:
card(id: card.id,
  draggable: %{payload: %{type: :card, id: card.id}})

# Target — declares what it accepts and the handler:
column(id: :archive,
  drop_target: %{accepts: [:card], on_drop: {self(), :archive_card}})

# Events:
{:drag, :begin,     %{session_id: 7, source_id: "card:123", payload: %{...}}}
{:drag, :over,      %{session_id: 7, target_id: :archive,   x: 240, y: 100}}
{:drag, :leave,     %{session_id: 7, target_id: :archive}}
{:drag, :drop,      %{session_id: 7, target_id: :archive,   payload: %{...}}}
{:drag, :end,       %{session_id: 7, accepted: true}}     # always fires last
{:drag, :cancel,    %{session_id: 7}}                      # if interrupted
```

**Design choices to settle when implementing:**
- **Session ID allocation.** Native side mints a monotonic per-process
  counter; expires when terminal phase fires. Cross-platform ID? Or per-
  platform — they're never compared.
- **Cross-widget routing.** A drag *starts* on widget A and *ends* on widget
  B. The address shape needs to identify both. Options: (a) the drag
  session has its own pseudo-address `%Address{widget: :drag_session, id: N}`
  and target widgets fan out to interested parents; (b) source events go to
  the source's parent, target events go to the target's parent, the
  framework correlates by session_id.
- **Payload schema.** Drag carries arbitrary data — text, image, custom
  Mob types. Decide: typed payloads via a tagged map (`%{type: :text, value: "x"}`),
  or free-form? Probably typed — apps need to validate `accepts:` lists.
- **Cancellation guarantees.** Phone call interruption mid-drag, app
  backgrounded mid-drag, source widget unmounted mid-drag. Native side must
  fire `:cancel` for every started session. No silent drops.
- **Visual feedback.** Drag preview, drop-zone highlights — these are
  rendering concerns, not event concerns. Probably a `Mob.Drag` runtime
  module that handles the preview; events only carry semantic state.
- **Native APIs to use.**
  - iOS: `UIDragInteraction` / `UIDropInteraction` (UIKit) or `.draggable` /
    `.dropDestination` (SwiftUI 16+). The SwiftUI ones are simpler.
  - Android: `View.startDragAndDrop` + `DragEvent` listeners (View system),
    or the equivalent in Compose's pointer-input gestures.

**Estimated scope:** ~1500 LOC + tests. 1–2 weeks of focused work.

#### Multi-touch tracking

**Use cases:** drawing apps, custom gesture surfaces, music apps, games.
Niche — most touch interactions are well-served by `on_tap`, `on_pinch`,
`on_drag`. Real apps that need raw multi-touch want pressure, tilt,
azimuth too (stylus territory).

**Speculative API:**

```elixir
canvas(on_touch: {self(), :draw})

# Events (one stream per finger, identified by finger_id):
{:touch, :down, %{finger_id: 0, x: 100, y: 200, pressure: 0.8}}
{:touch, :move, %{finger_id: 0, x: 105, y: 210, pressure: 0.9}}
{:touch, :up,   %{finger_id: 0, x: 200, y: 300, pressure: 0.0}}
```

**Design choices:**
- **Finger identity.** iOS `UITouch.identifier`, Android
  `MotionEvent.getPointerId`. Stable for the duration of the gesture.
- **Throttling.** Same Tier-1 model as Batch 5 — high-frequency, needs
  per-finger throttle config.
- **Pressure / tilt / azimuth.** Optional payload fields, present on
  hardware that supports them.

**Estimated scope:** ~600 LOC + tests. ~1 week.

#### Stylus / Pencil

**Use cases:** drawing, handwriting recognition, note-taking. Apple Pencil
+ Galaxy Note + Surface Pen.

**Speculative API:** identical to multi-touch but with extra payload fields
(`pressure`, `tilt_x`, `tilt_y`, `azimuth_radians`, `tool: :pencil | :finger`).
Apps want pressure curves applied (linear / quadratic / exponential) — provide
a `Mob.Stylus.curve/2` helper rather than configuring the curve at the
native layer.

**Estimated scope:** ~400 LOC on top of multi-touch.

#### Hover (iPad trackpad / pointer devices)

**Use cases:** showing tooltips, highlighting hover targets, custom cursor
images. Affects ~zero current Mob apps; relevant when iPad/macOS/web port
becomes a real target.

**Speculative API:**

```elixir
button("?", on_hover: {self(), :show_tooltip})

# Events:
{:hover, :enter, %{x: 100, y: 200}}
{:hover, :move,  %{x: 105, y: 210}}
{:hover, :exit,  %{x: 110, y: 220}}
```

**Design notes:** hover is the most aggressive high-frequency event —
moving a cursor across a screen produces hundreds of events per second.
Default to native-side processing (e.g., "is the cursor over this widget?"
as a cheap predicate) and only emit semantic transitions to BEAM.

**Estimated scope:** ~400 LOC + tests, mostly per-platform.

### Selective category enable (deferred)

If batch 5+ benchmarks show meaningful overhead, add per-category enable so
subscribers only register OS observers they actually use. For batches 1–4
this isn't worth the API surface — the cost is dominated by the OS firing
the notification, which happens regardless of whether we observe.
